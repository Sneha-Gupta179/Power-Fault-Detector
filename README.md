# Power-Fault-Detector
The objective of this project is to enable a accurate fault identification for maintaining power grid reliability.

## üîç Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically detect and classify different types of electrical faults in a power distribution system. The model leverages **IBM AutoAI** within **Watson Studio** to automate the end-to-end machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, and deployment.

## ‚ö° Problem Statement

Electric power systems are susceptible to various types of faults such as line-to-ground, line-to-line, and three-phase faults. Rapid and accurate detection of these faults is crucial for maintaining grid stability and minimizing downtime.

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

Using IBM Cloud Lite services, particularly AutoAI in Watson Studio, a machine learning model is trained on electrical phasor data (voltage and current) to classify system conditions into normal or specific fault types. The model is deployed using Watson Machine Learning, enabling real-time fault detection via REST APIs.
